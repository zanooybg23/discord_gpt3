GPT-Discord-Bot
This is a simple Discord bot that allows you to generate text using GPT. The bot is packaged as a standalone executable file, so you don't need to install any dependencies or run any commands.

Usage
Download the bot.exe file from the releases page.
Double-click the bot.exe file to run the program.
A window will appear asking you to input your Discord bot's key. Input the key and click "OK".
Once the bot is running, it will automatically generate a response based on any text input it receives.
Example
Input: "I'm feeling lucky today"
Output: "That's great! What's making you feel lucky?"

Requirements
This bot uses the gpt4free package to generate text using GPT. The gpt4free package is included in the bot.exe file, so you don't need to install it separately.
