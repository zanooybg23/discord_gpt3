# GPT-Discord-Bot

This is a simple Discord bot that allows you to generate text using GPT-3. The bot is packaged as a standalone executable file, so you don't need to install any dependencies or run any commands.

## Usage

1. Download the `GPT3.exe` file from the releases page.
2. Double-click the `GPT3.exe` file to run the program.
3. A window will appear asking you to input your Discord bot's key. Input the key and click "OK".
4. Once the bot is running, it will automatically generate a response based on any text input it receives.

## Example

Input: "I'm feeling lucky today"

Output: "That's great! What's making you feel lucky?"

## Requirements

This bot uses the gpt4free package to generate text using GPT-3. The gpt4free package is included in the gpt3.exe file, so you don't need to install it separately.

However, the following features must be enabled on https://discord.com/developers in order to use them properly.
